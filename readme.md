Explanation

In this project, we have developed a sentiment analysis model to predict the sentiment of financial news headlines. We started by loading and preprocessing the data, followed by visualizing the sentiment distribution. After preprocessing the text data, we split the dataset into training and testing sets. We used a nltk to convert the text data into numerical features and trained a logistic regression model. The model's performance was evaluated using accuracy, classification report, and confusion matrix. Finally, we demonstrated how to use the trained model to predict sentiment for new headlines
